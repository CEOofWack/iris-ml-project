# iris-ml-project
Simple machine learning demo that trains a scikit-learn k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier on the Iris dataset and evaluates accuracy with a train/test split.

## What it does
- Loads the Iris dataset
- Splits data into train/test
- Trains `KNeighborsClassifier`
- Predicts labels and prints accuracy
- Runs inference on a sample input
